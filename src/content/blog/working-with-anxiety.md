Anxiety is a universal human experienceâ€”therapy aims not to *eliminate* it, but to change our relationship with it.

2. Skills training: breathing, grounding, attentional flexibility.
3. Gradual exposure: retraining avoidance loops.
4. Values orientation: making life bigger than symptom management.
